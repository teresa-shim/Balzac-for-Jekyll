I'm just testing it **works** or *not*. Is it OK?

OK. I think it's matter of layout. Isn't it?

Hmmm..... how can I handle this?

It's too hard too handle text. I want to remove that effect of super big character... **But how?**
I think it's too... complicated.

I have to go to bed today. It's done for today... 


But I still don't know why it has problem to pull request. There is no problem in local. http://127.0.0.1:4000/jekyll-theme-libretto/ 

Oh I forget how to make link through Markdown. Of course, it's no use because that address is for itself.
